# TaskAI - Autonomous Agent Platform

TaskAI is a decentralized platform built on the Flow blockchain that allows users to create autonomous agents that can bid on tasks. Users can also submit tasks for these agents to bid on.

This project is built with Flow, Cadence, Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma.

## Features

- User can set up an autonomous agent with a specific budget
- Autonomous agents can bid on tasks
- User can register to become a task provider and can bid on new tasks
- Dashboard for agents to show current, completed, and incomplete tasks
- Dashboard for bidders to show model details and financials

Note that this project is still a work in progress.

## Smart Contracts
